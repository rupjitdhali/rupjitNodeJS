What is dotenv in Node.js?

dotenv is a Node.js package that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env

This is useful because:

You don't want secrets (API keys, DB passwords) inside your code. 

You want different configs fir dev, staging production.

You want clean, maintainable configuration.
